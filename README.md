# python_identity_generator
Using existing modules to help create an identity generator - not that you actually need one.

## Getting Started
This script uses `request` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape information off of [https://www.fakepersongenerator.com/](https://www.fakepersongenerator.com/) 
to provide a fake identity. There are quite a few flaws in regards with parsing the information but it works overall. The information this site provides
is quite excess to the point that it's scary.
